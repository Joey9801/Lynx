This software is designed to work on the Lynx dev r1 board, and other pin-compatible boards.
It takes in SPI data from SPI1, and generates streams of IQ values.
Error coding and constellation mapping is easily changeable.

Process:
The main loop in lynx.c manages the priorities of the various tasks
What needs to be done is stored in 'status', tasks of higher priorities are in the less significant bits of this value.
Every iteration of the main loop:
	If there is nothing being transmitted, and a packet is ready, transmission begins
	If there is a free input buffer, data input is enabled
	If there is a raw packet ready to be error coded, it is done (all in one go)
	UNLESS there is an error coded packet ready to be mapped to a constellation
